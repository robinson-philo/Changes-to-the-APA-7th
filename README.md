*        When citing three or more authors in-text, use the first author’s name and et al. for every citation, including the first.

as BBC News, etc.) goes in publisher position. Do not italicize.

*        For DOIs, always use the URL format: http://doi.org /.....Include DOI for all works where one is assigned (use Crossref to check https://www.crossref.org/guestquery/ [www.crossref.org]), even if using hard copy of source.

*        If no DOI assigned only include URL if source not found in academic library database. Use URL linking directly to source used. Do not use URL or name of database unless the work is only available in an academic database
or online archive (such as works archived in ERIC), include the name of the database/archive followed by the URL for the work if it doesn’t require a login. If it does require a login, use URL for login page.

*        DOIs and URLs should be live hyperlinks.

*        Do not use Retrieved by... unless you need to include a retrieval date (for sources that are updated periodically). Otherwise, publisher name or page numbers for journal articles is followed by period, then hyperlink. For
example: Random House. http://....

*        Religious and Classical Works are now included in reference list in addition to in-text citations.
